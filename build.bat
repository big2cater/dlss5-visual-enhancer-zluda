REM A clean copy of just what running the program needs, separate from
REM build\, which keeps CMake's and Ninja's own bookkeeping (CMakeFiles,
REM build.ninja, the *_autogen staging directories Qt's MOC step uses) so
REM later builds stay incremental. Deleting any of that from build\ itself
REM would work for one clean folder, but the next build would have to start
REM over from nothing -- full reconfigure, every source recompiled, Qt's
REM generated sources rebuilt from scratch -- for every change from then on.
REM
REM /MIR mirrors, so a file windeployqt drops on one run (say, before a flag
REM above was added) does not linger in dist\ after a later run stops
REM producing it.

REM nothing needed copying); only 8 and above is a real failure.
