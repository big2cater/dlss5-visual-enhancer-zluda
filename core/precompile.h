// Translating the network's code ahead of time, in parallel.
//
// Why this exists at all: the network ships two forms of every module, machine
// code for NVIDIA hardware and PTX. On an NVIDIA card the driver takes the
// machine code and there is nothing to compile, which is why it runs in real
// time there. On anything else the machine code is useless and the PTX has to
// be compiled -- once per machine, after which a cache answers.
//
// Why in parallel: a program loading the network gets its modules one at a
// time, so translation inside it is serial by construction and leaves every
// core but one idle. The cache is keyed by the content of a module rather than
// by who compiled it, so the same work done ahead of time in several processes
// is found later as a hit.
