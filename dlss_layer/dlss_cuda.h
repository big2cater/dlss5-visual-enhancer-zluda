// DLSS over the NGX CUDA backend, for GPUs that are not NVIDIA.
//
// The graphics NGX backends (D3D11/D3D12/Vulkan) route through the NVIDIA
// driver and are unusable here. The CUDA backend only needs a CUDA driver, and
// nvngx_dlss.dll resolves nvcuda.dll dynamically -- its import table lists only
// ADVAPI32, KERNEL32, USER32 and VERSION -- so a stand-in CUDA driver such as
// ZLUDA can serve it.
//
// This layer owns everything between a D3D12 frame and DLSS: shared textures,
// the CUDA import of them, and the NGX calls. It deliberately does not know
// where the game's buffers come from; the caller (a ReShade addon, RenoDX, or a
// test harness) passes them in.
