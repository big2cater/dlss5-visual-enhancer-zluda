// CopyResource cannot bridge that: D3D12 requires identical formats, so a frame
// can only reach the network through a shader.

// Two directions, and they are not symmetric. Coming in, the destination is our
// own texture and can carry an unordered access view, so a compute pass does
// it. Going out, the destination is a swapchain buffer, which is created by the
// game and generally allows no unordered access, so that direction has to be a
// draw into a render target view.
